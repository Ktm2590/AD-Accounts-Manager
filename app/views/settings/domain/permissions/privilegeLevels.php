            Privilege levels can be assigned at the District or OU level with propagation. So a group with
            permission for a School OU will have that same permission for all sub-OU's, unless explicitly set at a lower
            level.

            Permissions are different for users or groups, but they both are successive levels of access that inherit
            the
            previous level.
            A group with Change permission can also Read, but can not Add or Delete (for groups).
